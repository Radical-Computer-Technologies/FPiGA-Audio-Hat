# FPiGA-CoreLib
Radical Computer Technologies public repository for the FPiGA CoreLib including both HDL source for the core library as well as linterfacing software libraries/drivers for the Raspberry Pi and other "Pi-like" platforms.

## Overview
FPiGA was born from the need to establish a consistent, streamlined standard for interfacing FPGAs with Raspberry Pi–class platforms. Until now, no widely adopted methodology has existed, resulting in a fragmented landscape of incompatible and inconsistent implementations.

FPiGA addresses this gap with a “Keep It Simple, Stupid” (KISS) philosophy — aiming to reduce complexity while enhancing reliability. The project focuses on delivering a cohesive ecosystem that includes:
* Standardized hardware interfaces
* Reusable HDL IP libraries
* Unified device drivers
* Consistent hardware abstraction libraries
By defining clear and reliable standards, FPiGA simplifies development, encourages interoperability, and accelerates innovation across FPGA and Raspberry Pi integration projects.
